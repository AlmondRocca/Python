I tried reinstalling python on my windows machine
I tried upgrading pip, python, wheel, setuptools, ez_setup
I tried setting the environment variables again
I tried whatever the terminal told me
My best guess is that its a compatibility problem with mingw that I had for C++
Also I cant pip install anything

On the linux machine it comes with nltk by default but I cant import nltk and cant download the nltk thing.
I manually downloaded and extracted it but I cant find documentation on where it should go.

it said this:

  Attempted to load tokenizers/punkt/PY3/english.pickle

  Searched in:
    - '/home/csuser/nltk_data'
    - '/usr/nltk_data'
    - '/usr/share/nltk_data'
    - '/usr/lib/nltk_data'
    - '/usr/share/nltk_data'
    - '/usr/local/share/nltk_data'
    - '/usr/lib/nltk_data'
    - '/usr/local/lib/nltk_data'
    - ''

so I went and put it in there and it seems to have worked.
